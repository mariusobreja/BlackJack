# Blackjack game
---
#### Objective:
Build a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It’s a single page, that opens in the browser, and lets the user play. The rules for Blackjack are here, it’s a relatively simple game. Your implementation just needs to give the "hit" and "stand" options to the player (no betting), feel free to figure out what UI you prefer, as long as the user understands what is happening and can play multiple games.

#### Languages used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

#### How to Play:

###### Game Rules
The rules are simple: you draw cards, playing against the dealer, to get a score as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Once you have been dealt two cards you are given the choice of whether to stand (settle for your current score) or hit (draw another card). If your score is over 21 then you bust. If you get a total of 21, you win blackjack! Have fun!
